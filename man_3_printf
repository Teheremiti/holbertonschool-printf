NAME
_printf - formats and prints data

SYNOPSIS
#include "main.h"
int _printf(const char *format, ...);

FILES

DESCRIPTION
The _printf function produces output according to a format as described below. It is called by a variable number of arguments and writes output to stdout, the standard output stream. The format string controls the output and specifies how subsequent arguments are converted for it.

Format of the FORMAT string
The format string is a character string, beginning and ending with double quotes " ".The format string is composed of zero or more directives: ordinary characters (not %), which are copied unchanged to the output stream; and conversion specifications, each of which results in fetching zero or more subsequent arguments.Each conversion specification is introduced by the character %, and ends with a conversion specifier. 

The overall syntax of a conversion specification is:

%[conversion specifier]

The arguments must correspond properly (after type promotion) with the conversion specifier. By default, the arguments are used in the order given where each conversion specifier asks for the next argument (and it is an error if insufficiently many arguments are given).

Interpreted sequences are:
A character that specifies the type of conversion to be applied. The conversion specifiers and their meanings are:

%% → a '%' character is written. No argument is converted. The complete conversion specification is '%%'.

%c →  a single character (char) is written.

%s → the const char * argument is expected to be a pointer to an array of character type(pointer to a string).  Characters from the array are written up to (but not including) a terminating null byte('\0');

%d and %i → decimal base 10 number is written.

Naturally special characters:
To print following special characters \, “, ‘, % C language and so _printf function use backslash \ as an escape character to change the meaning of the next character after it. Without a backslash, special characters have a natural special meaning and they print as they appear. 

Alternately special characters:
They normally print as you would expect, but when you add a backslash, it invokes their alternate meaning and they become special. Here is the partial list of these characters: \a audible alert, \f form feed, \n newline (linefeed), \r carriage return, \t tab, \v vertical tab.

RETURN VALUES
Upon successful return, _printf function returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

If the format string is empty, or a single ‘%’ character is passed to the _printf function, the functions terminates and returns -1 value.

If memory allocation with malloc() fails when an integer is passed to a function, the function terminates and returns -2 value.

EXEMPLES
If the format string is composed only of characters, each of them is printed exactly as it appears. _printf(“Hello World”); will output “Hello World”.

For printing special characters a use of the backslash espace character is neede as follows. _printf(“\\, \", ’, \%"); will output “\, “, ‘,’%”.

To print a ‘%’ character one can use ‘\%’ or ‘%%’ notation. _printf(“\% and %%”); will output “% and %”.

If the %c specifier is used _printf(“A character: %c”, ‘H’); will output “A character: H”.

If the %s specifier is used _printf(“A string: %s”, “Hello World”); will output “A string: Hello World”;

If the %d or %i specifiers are used _printf(“A first integer is %d, the second integer is %i”, 10, 20); will output “A first integer is 10, the second integer is 20”.
